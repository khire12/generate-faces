# generate-faces

This is the fourth project under Udacity's Deep Learning Nano-degree 

Goal: To learn how to implement DC-GAN and train it to generate new imaged from faces from a given dataset using Pytorch

Dataset: Celeba Face Dataset (pre-processed version)
  - image size: 64 x 64 x3
  - Image resized used after preprocessing = 32 x 32 x 3
  - batch size: 128
  - Total images: 89931
